Greetings. I'm Mingrui (go by Myron) and I'm a bachelor graduate from the University of Toronto in a STEM program, now self teaching programming. I am fluent in Java, JavaScript and SQL; intermediate in HTML and CSS; beginner in Python. My goal is to fulfill a role where I can leverage my skills in both software development and science.

I'm always eager to learn new technology (sometimes to my detriment; after being frustrated by how obscure one Java GUI framework is, I decided to move on... and learn another (also obscure) Java GUI framework) and a fast learner. Currently I'm learning ReactJS and found it quite fascinating and slightly magical. It's nice to google your technology and get more than 5 responses.

Currently I'm working on a ReactJS web application; it will be uploaded to my GitHub repository once finished.
